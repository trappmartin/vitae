## Martin Trapp - Almost Surely

I'm a scientist working on probabilistic machine learning at Aalto University. My research interests focus on probabilistic models that exploit structural properties (e.g., symmetries or decomposability) for exact computations, prior specification and inference in Bayesian deep learning, and Bayesian nonparametrics.

In addition to my research, I'm part of the open-source project Turing.jl.

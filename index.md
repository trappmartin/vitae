I'm a scientist working on probabilistic machine learning.
My research interests focus on probabilistic machine learning approaches that exploit structural properties, e.g. symmetries or decomposability, to allow efficient and  exact computations while maintaining the capability to model complex relationships in data.

In addition to my research on tractable probabilistic models, I'm part of the open-source project Turing.jl.
